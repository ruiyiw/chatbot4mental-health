Whilst Freshers Week can feel like this massive thing that everyone goes to, it can help to remember that not going to an event doesn’t mark you out as different or place an ‘I hear voices’ label on your forehead. There are lots of reasons people don’t go to an event. It’s OK not to go and you don’t need to give anyone a reason.",,,

But, if you find your voices give you a hard time try to be kind to yourself. There is no (useful) instruction manual for university life, and there may be times when things go awry. It’s OK to ask for support. Yet we know it’s not always easy to ask for it and sometimes the support offered isn’t helpful. See the back cover for ideas on who to contact. Some people find the voices they hear use shame as a way of keeping people isolated (and/or safe). Just because the voices say you messed up it doesn’t mean it’s true (and even if it is it doesn’t mean you should feel ashamed).",,,

Most others probably also have these mixed feelings. It can be a good way to break the ice and get a friend by saying that you are nervous or don’t know what to expect. Others may relax and find you interesting for opening up” Even those without voices & visions can feel disconnected in the first few weeks (or months) of university. So many of us are not sure about what we’re doing or where we fit ... so sometimes being honest about that can be a welcome break for those who are feeling like they need to wear a confident mask.,,,

Whilst going with the flow can lead to some great experiences, some of us prefer a bit more predictability (and that’s OK too). At Freshers Week you’ll be introduced to different societies and socials - but many of these are also advertised on the Student Union’s website if you want to suss them out first. You might want to get some recommendations from a uni social media group for new students, or speak with someone at the Student Union, Wellbeing or Disability Office.",,,

It helps me feel more confident ... like I’m going somewhere which gives less space for the voices to freak me out” Planning ahead can also involve working out what spaces on the university campus feel OK to retreat to when stuff gets a bit much or you need to recharge.

I’d suggest making a list of anything that might stress you out and how you would cope with them” Whilst you can (mostly) control what happens in your own room, sharing accommodation means there’s a lot more that is outside of your field of influence. You may encounter people turning the hall light on and off at different times, banging doors, people speaking in the corridor, middle of the night fire alarms and security staff checking the premises. Some of these things might be fine, but you may find others trigger your voices or visions … especially if you have sensory sensitivities or post-traumatic reactions. Having ways of managing these responses planned out can help. Some people use draught excluders help block out light. Comfy headphones or ear defenders can help with the noise. Having familiar objects (anchors) around can help the space feel more like your own. Customise the space so it works for you.",,,

Add in the sensory stuff and the first step out of the door can be hard – a lot of time I didn’t manage it. Telling other people ‘you might need to come and get me’ helped.” The downside to creating a safer space in your room can be that, if you’re struggling with socialising and the unknown, it can get tricky to leave. That’s natural, however some people find being alone with their voices/ visions can make things worse.

I can study in busy spaces and feel like no-one else is there Whilst much of this guide, understandably, talks about ways of navigating the challenges of universit life with voices and visions - that’s not the whole story. Sometimes, the skills we’ve developed to live with our experiences can be an asset.

You don’t owe anyone any personal information about yourself. You don’t need to disclose your experiences or speak about anything that makes you uncomfortable. However, if you think there may be times when you struggle with the academic side of things then it can help to build connections with those who will be in a position to help you out. It can feel weird taking the first step. It’s about getting key people on side so they’re aware of what might happen and are in your corner if it does. “I made contact with my personal tutor early. With COVID you don’t really meet them unless there’s a problem. They will see my file – my disability disclosure. I say: ‘You’re going to see my name, it’ll say this [the diagnosis]. I just want 15 minutes to say what excites me about this course” Sometimes, especially if the department know about your diagnosis (if you have one) it can be useful to make an effort to help them see you as a motivated student challenging stereotypes. “I went to Admin and introduced myself: “I’ve spoken to Wellbeing, but can you please talk to me about the common mistakes students make on the course re: deadlines in a crisis”. They know what wiggle room there is, they know the regulations and they would rather help in advance” Whilst many of us instinctively try to present a confident exterior, this sometimes extends to pretending that everything’s OK when it really isn’t (and avoiding the academic team when we’re getting behind). As natural as this is, it can lead to even more stress and risks leaving supervisors/ tutors feeling frustrated. If you think there may be times when you’ll need some flexibility, having good relationship with the course admin team (who know the regulations inside out) can help you navigate complex university processes and avoid unnecessary stress.",,,

People might not always ask and sometimes you need to speak out when you are struggling with life/elements of the course” If hearing voices, seeing visions or having other related experiences causes you difficulties that have a ‘substantial’ and ‘long term’ negative impact on you it counts as a ‘disability’ according to the The Equality Act 2010. The Equality Act requires education providers, including universities, to make ‘reasonable adjustments’ to enable students with disabilities to take part on an equal basis. Reasonable adjustments can include things like: • Extra time to complete coursework or examinations • Rest breaks during exams • Taking exams in a different space (perhaps with access to music or other coping strategies like walking around) • A quiet space to access if needed • Flexibility around timetabling (e.g. minimising morning lectures if you’re taking sedating medication) • Additional study support (inc mentoring, planning for assessments and organising notes) • Things that the lecturers can do (or not do) that would make things easier for you. “Your Disability Office can ask for reasonable adjustments for you, including lecturers not picking on you in lectures/seminars/classes to answer questions unless you voluntarily put your hand up to answer. Knowing that I had this provision during my Masters made things feel SO much safer” You also may be eligible for a Disabled Students Allowance which can pay for things like: • Computer equipment specialist software• Study support • Dictaphone",,,

As such, there may be a time during your studies when things get on top of you. That’s understandable.

I’ll start with Kyri and Lou who are two dinosaur friends from New Zealand. SPOILER ALERT Lou has a ‘calm inner voice,’ and in one of the clips we saw, Lou is introducing Kyri to his calm inner voice which he speaks to when he is in one of his ‘sticky situations.’ Instead of the voice being portrayed as something to hide and be ashamed off, Lou seems happy to share and talk about the voice, even making Kyri feel jealous that she doesn’t have her own calm inner voice! There is an interesting turn here when Kyri becomes annoyed and frustrated that she cannot hear Lou’s voice and she thinks that the voice is saying mean things about her. I appreciated how this aspect highlights the feelings of frustration in regards to hearing voices, and it being a struggle to communicate with others about it when they don’t also have this experience. Another clip highlighted unhelpful times when voices occur. Lou is feeling happy and resting against a tree to take a nap. Suddenly, seemingly out of nowhere, the voice asks him if he is ok because he thought Lou had ‘called for him.’ Even though Lou manages to stay calm and relaxed and politely tells his calm inner voice that he is not needed today, there is content around how sometimes voices can interrupt daily life when you don’t want them around. For a programme that appeals to quite a young age range, I feel that Kyri and Lou starts to de stigmatize the idea of hearing voices, without sugar coating it too much, recognising some of the distress voices can cause.

Voices+and+Visions+in+Children+TV+and+Film+poster+blog.pdf,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIOyB9ZXn8s,"The second example was the main song from Frozen 2 ‘Into the Unknown.’ The essence of this movie song is Elsa starts to hear a singing voice that no one else can hear. Initially she seems confused and embarrassed that she is hearing this beautiful sound, so she doesn’t tell anyone. Initially, Elsa tries to deny its existence claiming that she ‘can’t hear,’ and ‘blocking out your calls.’ Unlike Kyri and Lou, but maybe more common in stereotypical views of voice hearers, there is a desire to ignore the voice and not engage with it. This can be due to fear of what might happen, this is often experienced by children and young people who come to us at Voice Collective. However, I sense Elsa has a feeling of wanting to delve ‘into the unknown’ to find out the possible meaning of the voice, even if she is a worried, ‘I’m afraid of what I am risking if I follow you’. During the song, Elsa is able to accept her inquisitive nature and decides to follow the voice. She begins questioning, ‘what do you want?’ ‘are you here to distract me?’ and seems to have a powerful realisation when she admits that she really does want to listen! Elsa uses her powers and imagination to create beautiful animals and mythical creatures. At one point the prancing horse and the singing voice run away and Elsa explains that she doesn’t want to be left alone. This part of the song has creatively portrayed how some voice hearers empowered and connected with their voices that if they were to stop hearing them they would feel lonely. Even though Elsa does feel scared by the singing voice at the start, her journey and her experience seem very positive, glittery and magical, which is obviously not experienced by everyone who hears voices. In fact in can be quite the opposite experience. This is something I am learning to check in on during my time at Voice Collective – being nonjudgmental of voice hearer’s experiences.

I have worked in statutory services in the past and some of the views I supported I now regret. I once supported an 8 year old girl who had already been diagnosed with ‘psychosis.’ Despite some of my attempts to suggest to her school to support her more creatively to explore and play in her own way, there was an underlying expectation to continue to tell her that the voices and things she was seeing were not real. How differently I would approach this situation now after becoming a part of Voice Collective! I acknowledge that some of these examples of films, TV, and music could be seen to invalidate or de-value how scary and painful some voice hearing experiences can be for children and young people. The media might be viewed by some as either heavily stigmatizing hearing voices, or sugar coating it as only positive and exciting experiences. I feel however that these examples could be taken as providing some nuance to the experience. Not all media, TV and film is portraying voice hearing as a ‘dangerous’ or ‘psychotic’ experience. For younger children being subjected to these more positive visuals can help them to develop a more balanced understanding of the experiences for voice hearers.",,,
Winston-Wish-PCP.pdf,www.winstonswish.org,"Hearing Voices in childhood and adolescence is actually very common – about 1 in 9 1 . Some young people hear voices that are friendly and encouraging, others hear voices that are critical and controlling, and many hear a mixture 2 .For those young people who have experienced a traumatic event, such as death, they may hear the voice or see the image of this person3 . We know that wanting to hear the voice of the person who has died can be comforting and wanting to hear it can be part of their grieving process. You can read some more information about grief and bereavement on Winston’s Wish website here: www.winstonswish.org or call their support line on: 08088 020 021. They are a children’s and young person’s bereavement support charity. But as a parent, carer or professional, you might be worried that the voices of the young person are unrelated to their grieving process. Maybe this young person was hearing voices a long time before the bereavement. Or the young person has commented that the voices are no longer offering them comfort. This is when it can be a bit harder for young people to cope with their voices and you might want to reach out to us for a bit of extra support. The young person might want to speak to someone at Voice Collective to help them understand their experiences a bit more. Or perhaps they want to join one of our peer support groups and meet others who might be having similar experiences to them. You or the young person might feel like the voices have nothing to do with death or grief – and that’s ok too.

When voices and visions are very intrusive, powerful or distressing, it is normal for the whole family to feel overwhelmed and powerless.

We’d simply hear voices that made us laugh or smile. Recovery is more than just finding ways of dealing with voices. It’s about healing from the problems that caused such difficult experiences in the first place. Rachel, Voice Collective Project Manager and voice-hearer what do we mean by recovery? For us, recovery simply means living the life you choose. Whilst many young people who hear voices aren’t distressed by them, overwhelming voices can really get in the way of ‘normal’ life. They can affect a young person’s sense of self, confidence, self-esteem, mood, friendships, schoolwork and family relationships. Sometimes the situation can feel hopeless to both the young person and those who love them - as if everyone is powerless and stuck in a situation out of their control. The good news is that even those young people affected by intensely confusing and distressing voices can, and do, recover. Recovery is an individual journey. As with all journeys, there are many ways that we can travel towards it. Our job, as supporters, is to help a young person find the way that works for them. Young people who recover may, or may not, still hear voices and see visions. In many ways, this isn’t important. The key is that they are living their life - a life with highs, lows, challenges, joy, mistakes and victories. When someone has recovered, the voices are no longer in the driving seat. Perhaps most importantly, the life problems triggering the voices have been understood and dealt with.",,,

According to Dr Escher’s research, 60% of children and young people stop hearing voices once the problems underlying them have been addressed. If your child’s voices are very distressing, the idea that they may continue to hear voices and recover can sound strange. After all, how could anyone feel good if they hear voices that say horrible things and tell them to stay away from people they care about? One way of understanding this is by thinking about people in your own life that you have found hard to cope with. Whilst, in an ideal world, we would stop having contact with people we find toxic - sometimes this isn’t possible. If they are work colleagues, extended family members or a best friend’s partner, we are stuck with them whether we like it or not. In this situation, as we can’t change or escape the other person, the only thing we can do is change ourselves. Sometimes this just limits their influence over us, but it can also produce a similar change in the other person. Your child’s relationship with their voices can be understood in a similar way. Recovery can happen when: ) The voices stay the same, but the young person changes how they feel about them. For example, imagine a child who is about to take a test and a voice tells them that they’re stupid and will fail. If this child knows that the voice says things when they’re nervous, they can reply: ‘I’m worried about failing, but I’ve studied so I’m going to do my best. Even if I do fail, I can always re-take it. I’ll be OK either way’. ) The voices change. For example, a nasty voice that that tells them to stay away from other people can sometimes be a protector voice in disguise. When the child no longer fears other people the voice may, instead, become friendly and supportive. According to Dr Escher’s research, 60% of children and young people stop hearing voices once the problems underlying them have been addressed. If your child’s voices are very distressing, the idea that they may continue to hear voices and recover can sound strange.

You are the one they most rely on and trust. Follow your instincts and remember you know your child better than anyone else’ Anne*, Parent of a child supported by Voice Collective Voices and visions carry important messages about how your child feels about themselves and their world. Rather than speaking directly, these messages are hidden in code. Difficult and distressing voices often reflect difficult and distressing emotions and life experiences. Young people can, and do, find ways of coping with voices, visions and the emotions that drive them. Developing these strategies will give your child valuable skills that will help them get the most out of their life, whether or not they continue to hear voices.",,,

What’s the problem? One of the first steps to helping your child find ways of dealing with problematic voices and visions is to begin making sense of what difficulties or issues may be triggering them. Different problems suggest different solutions. Sometimes, the underlying issue may be obvious. You may be aware that your child has been bullied, recently bereaved or witnessed a serious crime. Often, though, things need closer investigation. Try to be aware of, and avoid, the blame game. Unless you intentionally caused your child harm, you are not to blame for their experiences. However, as well as looking at outside factors, it can be helpful to explore whether there is anything within the home that may be inadvertently contributing to your child’s difficult emotions (e.g. a loss or recent change). When your child is feeling calm, encourage them to talk to you about how they feel and - if they can - what the voices are saying. Some may find it easier to talk whilst writing, drawing or doing something active. When talking to your child it is important to stay calm and show that you’re interested in seeing things from their point of view. Some families find setting up a ‘worry box’ helpful to facilitate this. This gives the child the opportunity to write worries down as they occur and, if they want to, explore them later with someone they trust. Voices and visions are often linked to how the child feels about themselves and their world, providing valuable clues about the issues they are facing. For example, a child who hears voices that tells them to repeat a task until they get it right may be feeling very anxious and insecure. A child whose voices shout at them may be feeling angry at themselves or at someone else. We found out that Sam is being bullied at school. His voices shout at him, threaten him and say all kinds of horrible things. He carries the bullies inside, now. I hate knowing he feels so bad, but at least now we can help Jane*, Parent of a child supported by Voice Collective If your child hears very angry or destructive voices, they probably feel very afraid and powerless. As horrible as these voices can be, don’t forget that they carry meaning too. Try not to be afraid of the voices, even if your child is very scared. Once your child is calm, you can start to make sense of what’s going on for them, but your immediate priority is to help them find a way of calming down and feeling safe again. Remember: you don’t need to do this alone. There are lots of agencies out there who are willing and able to help.",,,

Identify, and build on, strengths Everyone, no matter how stressed out, has natural ways of managing difficult feelings or situations. If you can find out what strategies your child naturally uses, you may be surprised at how resourceful they are! Create a list with your child and encourage them to keep it safe. If you can, look for the secret ingredient of each strategy - try to understand what it is that makes it useful. Is it distracting? Comforting? Creative? Expressive? Active? Calming? The more you understand, the easier it will be to create tailor-made strategies with your child that really work! Often, when young people feel overwhelmed, they can struggle to think of anything they can do to manage difficult times. Discussing coping strategies can remind them of how hopeless their situation feels. You can help by ‘holding the hope’ and remembering that they can - and will - discover ways of dealing with this.

Work together to find a solution A major part of your child’s journey to recovery is finding their own coping strategies. It can be helpful to think of it building up a toolbox that will help your child deal with a range of situations and feelings. Everyone is different, so there is no magic formula. However, you can help engage your child in this creative process.

Use them as a starting point, for inspiration, and not as an instruction manual. See www.voicecollective.co.uk for more ideas. Calming * * * Often, voices and visions are triggered or made worse by feelings of stress and anxiety. They may get louder, nastier or more distracting the more stressed your child gets. Even if the voices are triggered by something else, hearing them may make your child feel scared or frightened These tips can be handy if your child needs to calm down and relax. They are a good place to start, and they are tips for life - not just for voices. Your child may need help remembering them in difficult moments. In our experience, it can really help to talk someone through these exercises - this is where your help is invaluable. Find a calming ritual A ritual, in this sense, is just something familiar that your child can do when they need to feel safe. It could be anything from making a hot drink, playing scales on a musical instrument, practising tai chi/yoga, bouncing a ball, reading a reassuring poem or story, watching a favourite programme, holding a favourite toy/blanket or saying a prayer. Some young people find safety in patterns - in which case puzzles and doodling may be helpful too. Your child may find writing their own mantra helpful. This can either contradict the voices, or remind the them of their strength and safety. For example, “I’m safe here. No-one is going to hurt me’ or ‘I am safe, I am strong. I am loved’. It can help to keep this on a card so the child can repeat it when they feel vulnerable.",,,

We get feedback from our body, so if our breathing is relaxed our brain says ‘OK - no threat here’. Conversely, if someone takes quick shallow breaths our brain can get the message that there really is something to worry about. If you ask someone who is really stressed to breathe deeply, they tend to force it and pant. This only makes them feel more stressed out. Instead, it can help to use a pattern to provide some structure and something to focus on. As a starting point, tap a steady beat and try this: Breathe in for 4, hold for 4, breathe out for 4, hold for 4 Repeat the cycle until you feel comfortable with it. Make sure you’re breathing from your belly, not from the top of your lungs. Your belly should expand, but your shoulders should stay still. Then, when you’re ready, try lengthening the ‘out’ breath whilst keeping the others the same length. Go from 4 to 6 to 8 Remember: Always go at the young person’s pace and aim for gentle breathing rather than anything athletic. It should be as relaxed as possible.

This is an adaptive response - after all, if we lived in the wild we would need to focus on threats such as lions to stay alive. Grounding exercises can help your child learn to shift their focus from the voices and visions to other sensory information (inside or outside of their body). It can be helpful to do this as a game, alongside your child. Name 5 things you can see, 5 things you can hear and 5 things you can touch. Name 4 things .... 3 things .... 2 things ... 1 thing. It’s ok to repeat things and you can cheat at any time. If your child runs out of sounds, it’s fine for either of you to make a noise. If they are hearing or seeing things at the time, they can include these too. The trick is to place them alongside the other things they can hear, see or sense to make them less powerful.",,,

With your child, choose a small object that they can hold whilst doing this imagining. This could be a pebble, shell, small toy or anything they find reassuring.

However, dominant and scary voices can sometimes end up ruling your whole family’s life - with everyone avoiding anything that could possibly make the voices worse. Whilst understandable, this can leave you feeling incredibly isolated. In time, it can feel very challenging - but not impossible - to regain the balance. Don’t panic! One of the most effective ways of readjusting the power balance is also the most simple. As a parent, the way you react to and speak about the voices is crucial. Try and stay as calm as possible. It helps to show your child that, whilst you recognise how frightened they feel, you are there to support them find a way through it. Getting support for you and your child Recovery does not happen in a vacuum. If your child is overwhelmed, or you’re struggling to cope, see it as a sign to get some extra help. This support can come from CAMHS (Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services), your GP, charities, Voice Collective, Young Minds, faith groups, community groups or your friends & family. You are not alone. Listening with kindness Some young people find it helpful to see difficult voices as bullies. Bullies have often been bullied themselves and, even though they can be nasty, they are often covering up their own vulnerability. Others find it helpful to treat nasty voices as if they are angry younger children that are having a temper tantrum. In both cases, being kind but firm can strip them of their power and help the young person feel more in control. 15 Questioning and challenging Voices don’t always tell the truth, so it can be helpful to support your child to gather evidence to see whether or not the voices they hear can be trusted. This is especially important if the voices make claims, predictions or make your child feel unsafe. Like people, voices can be questioned and challenged. You can set limits with them, as you would with unruly toddlers, and you can postpone or avoid the things they tell you to do. Sending the voices away If your child finds distraction strategies helpful, it shows that there are some times when they can ignore (or at least minimise) the voices they hear. Some young people can build on this to send the voices away for certain periods of time (starting small and building up gradually). Becoming an interpreter It can be helpful for young people to see voices as messengers that aren’t very good at communicating in a straightforward way. Their message can get confused, so we need to find ways of making sense of it. If your child is old enough, they may want to work with you as a detective to ‘de-code’ the voices and work out what problem they’re trying to communicate.",,,

Dealing with a child who hears voices is like going through a process in which the voices are accepted and the child will be supported based on the acceptance. It is a ‘searching together’

Dr Sandra Escher, Children Hearing Voices (p1)

So your child hears voices or has other unusual experiences? Don’t panic! You are not alone and neither is your child.

Many of the parents we work with tell us that they feel overwhelmed. Understandably, they often search for answers on the internet - but sometimes find the information they receive both confused and confusing.

Did you know that around 8% of children and young people hear voices that others don’t? Many more (up to 75%) have one off, or transient, experiences in their childhood. Most aren’t bothered by these experiences, and they don’t need extra support from mental health services.

However, even when the voices and visions cause a problem - there is hope. Research shows that 3 out of 5 young people may stop hearing voices within three years. Even those who continue to hear voices can learn to cope with these, going on to live a full and happy life.

This booklet is intended to give you some sensible and honest information about voices and visions to help you better understand what your child is experiencing.

It is the first of a series of four; each tackling issues parents/carers have told us are important to them.",,,

What are voices and visions?

When we talk about voices and visions, we mean any experience a young person has when they hear, see or sense something someone around them doesn’t. These experiences can include all five senses, hearing, sight, smell, taste and touch.

For some, this experience can be reassuring. For example, a young person who has recently moved house and feels isolated at school might value a voice that is there for them when they’re feeling down. For others, it can be confusing or frightening and cause distress.

What’s it like?

We are all unique. The way young people experience, and react to, voices and visions is individual. The following is an overview of the kinds of experiences young people often tell us about.

If you want to find out more about your child’s experiences, it can be helpful to ask them if they want to talk about it. Some young people will feel uncomfortable or embarrassed talking about voices and visions - but many are happy to open up once they know you’re ok to listen to them.",,,

I hear a little girl who’s scared. She cries sometimes, and I feel sorry for her. I also hear a man’s voice who tells me I’m no good. He’s worse when I’m struggling at school.

Some people hear voices talking when no-one is around. These could be like the voices of people they know, or complete strangers. They might hear many voices, or just one. Voices can shout, whisper, be clear or muffled. They can speak in sentences or say single words. These voices can be male, female, old or young. Sometimes they have names, but not always. People can hear other types of sounds too, including knocking, crying or music.

Some voices can be positive - encouraging or supporting you. Others may say things that are confusing or distracting, perhaps echoing thoughts or repeating strange phrases. Some voices can be very frightening, saying things that are critical, threatening or commanding. Others are funny, saying things that make you laugh.",,,

I sometimes see people’s faces change. One minute they look normal and the next they look like stone statues. It freaks me out.

Some people see things that others don’t. These visions can be very clear and realistic, but they can also include fuzzy shapes, shadows and beams of light. Sometimes, it can seem as if people or objects around you are changing shape. As with voices, these visions can be reassuring, funny, frightening or distracting.",,,

Once, when I was travelling home on the tube, I started to smell something horrible. I thought we were being gassed

Some people smell things that remind them of their past. This could be something nice, like a favourite food or their mum’s perfume. Sometimes, when a child has been through a difficult or traumatic experience, they may smell things related to this experience. For example, a child whose house burned down may smell smoke when they are anxious. This can be very frightening, especially if the child doesn’t realise that this sensory experience belongs in the past.

Sometimes the smell isn’t linked to a particular memory, but can still be very worrying. For example, some young people smell gas, burning or rotting food. These smells can feel very real and leave them fearing for their safety.",,,

There are times when my tastebuds go a bit strange. I try and eat things, but everything tastes like it’s gone off.

It can be difficult to know if you’re tasting something that others can’t unless you taste something in your food and get someone else to try it too. This can make taste experiences particularly difficult to deal with.

Some young people get a strong bitter taste in their food or drink and, understandably, start to worry that there is something wrong with it. Others may taste things when they are not eating or drinking. They may tastesomething pleasant (like chocolate or a favourite food) or something they dislike (perhaps something bitter or metallic).",,,

I get worried that there’s something in the back of my neck. The more I think about it, the more I can feel it

Some people can feel things on their skin when there doesn’t seem to be anything there. They might feel something crawling over their skin, tickling them or pushing them. Sometimes people feel something underneath their skin, and this can lead them to feel really worried about what is happening to their body.

Understandably these experiences can be very confusing and frightening. It’s not as simple as this, though. For others, these experiences can be reassuring. For example, a young person who feels upset and lonely may feel reassured by a gentle hand on their shoulder. They might interpret it as a sign that someone is there to support them.",,,

Whilst some young people experience these things in only one of their senses, many have a combination. For example, they may both hear and see someone speaking to them. They might have a strange taste in their mouth just before they see a vision. They may both see, and feel, something on their skin.

The above is only a sample of the range of experiences young people can have. If you’re unsure what your child is experiencing, the best thing to do is ask if they feel OK talking to you about them. Show them that you’re interested in what they have to say, and stay calm even if their experiences sound very unusual. Remember that lots of young people have experiences like these.

We are all unique, so voices and visions affect each of us differently.

The negatives

For some, hearing voices or seeing visions can be a scary and overwhelming experience. If the voices or visions are distracting, or the young person copes by going inside themselves, they might get into trouble at school for not paying attention. They might find themselves getting frustrated easily, getting in to arguments or lashing out when it gets too much.

Others react to the voices by withdrawing and spending lots of time alone. Some develop ways of coping with their distress that can seem odd or unusual to others (counting, checking and completing rituals, for example).

If they are confused about the things they are thinking, feeling and experiencing, a young person may develop unusual beliefs. Whilst these can be helpful, providing a narrative or story to explain their situation, they can also result in more distress. Beliefs that leave the child powerless (e.g. government conspiracies) can cause a lot of fear and paranoia.

Negative voices can chip away at a young person’s self esteem and confidence. Attempts to manage feelings of hopelessness and powerlessness can include self harm, eating distress and substance misuse. Some young people hear very scary voices that threaten the people they care about, or tell them to hurt themselves.

Most of the young people we meet at Voice Collective tell us that they feel weird, freakish or wrong. In our society, hearing voices is associated with so many negative media stereotypes that many feel unable to talk with their closest friends or family about what’s going on for them. Others have already been bullied for being different or struggling with mental health problems.",,,

For some people, hearing voices or seeing visions can be a positive or helpful experience. Imagine being alone in your room at night, feeling worried about an exam at school when a familiar voice tells you that it’s going to be ok, or makes you laugh. Some young people hear voices that give good advice, or keep them company when they’re lonely.

Voices can be creative, helping give the young person ideas for poetry or artwork. Some writers, for example, say how the characters in their story speak to them and tell them what to write. A skill like that can be a wonderful asset.

Even distressing voices can have positive effects. A young person who can stand up to commanding or nasty voices is someone who can use those skills to assert themselves with bullies. Whilst critical voices can devastate a child’s self esteem, learning to deal with these can help a child become more sure of their identity and strengths.

Rather than seeing difficult voices as a purely negative experience, it’s helpful to remember that they are there for a reason. Difficult voices are usually linked to things that the young person is struggling to cope with. The positive impact of negative voices can, with the right support, be the young person and their supporters dealing with that problem.",,,

For many young people, the voices are neither wholly positive or negative - they are somewhere in the middle.

Young people can, and do, find ways of coping with any negative or difficult effects of their voices or visions. With the right support, we’ve seen young people grow and take control of their own experiences and get on with their lives. That members of the Voice Collective project team have their own experience of hearing voices is proof that negatives can be turned to positives. See our recovery booklet for more information.",,,

You know your son/daughter better than anyone. You should never doubt your judgement, or be afraid to ask for advice, support and help

Anne*, Parent of a child supported by Voice Collective

Why does it happen?

As frustrating as this may be, there is no single answer to why children and young people hear voices or see visions. There are lots of different ideas about this, so the important thing is to find an explanation that makes sense to you and your child.

Some possible explanations:

Trauma / difficult life events: This can include being bullied, changing schools, problems at home (divorce or arguing), abuse, bereavement, physical illness, being the victim of, or witnessing, a crime - anything that makes a child feel overwhelmed or powerless. These events can leave a child with powerful thoughts and feelings that can be linked to the voice or vision in some way.

Spiritual experiences: Some people hear the voice of God or other beings. For some, this can be life-affirming, but for others it can be very scary. Different religions and belief systems have their own ways of responding to these experiences, but it is good to remember that a voice claiming to be God or a demon isn’t necessarily telling the truth. If you, or your child, believe that they are having a spiritual experience it can be helpful to consult with a reputable spiritual advisor for guidance.

Individual difference: For some people, hearing voices or seeing things is just part of who they are. It’s like having green eyes or being left 11

handed. However, when young people are under stress these experiences can change and become difficult to cope with. This is a sign that they need extra support.

Special gift or sensitivity: Many cultures believe spirits can talk to humans. Some people believe they have a gift that helps them talk to ghosts and spirits. It can however be very confusing to develop this gift and your child may need support in doing this.

Emotional health problems: For some people their voices and visions can be triggered by how they’re feeling. For example, someone who feels really anxious may hear voices telling them they’re in danger. A young person who is struggling with feeling low, perhaps diagnosed with depression, may hear voices that tell them that they’re a bad person and should be punished. Someone who is struggling with an eating disorder may hear a voice telling them not to eat, or to binge and purge.

Physical health problems: Our state of mind is related to the state of our body. Not sleeping, being isolated, having a fever, epilepsy, severe infections and head injuries can all cause voices and visions in some people. See your GP if you think there may be a physical cause to your child’s experiences - they will be able to advise you.

Legal and illegal drugs: The substances we put in our body can affect our state of mind. Cannabis has been linked to the onset of voices and visions in some people. Others may feel their experiences are linked to heavy use of amphetamines or cocaine (drug induced psychosis). These experiences can be very intense, but are often short-lived.

In some cases, voices and visions can arise as rare side effects from prescription or over the counter medication. This includes some strong pain medication, antibiotics, antidepressants and antimalarials. If you want to find out more, please speak to your GP or a pharmacist.",,,

Psychosis is just a word. It has no power to change the future or the past. See your child, not the label

Desmond*, Parent of a child supported by Voice Collective

Psychosis is simply an umbrella term that is used when young people are struggling with voices, visions or unusual beliefs and seem to be out of touch with reality. This term is also used when people seem to have very muddled or confused thinking, which can make it difficult for the people around them to understand what they are saying.

Whilst this term may sound very frightening, it can be helpful to see it as a description of a state of mind rather than a predictor of future problems. Stress, trauma, drug use, overwhelming spiritual experiences and physical health problems can also cause periods of psychosis. With support, the young person can deal with the underlying issues and recover.

Some parents worry about whether their child has schizophrenia. With so much negative media coverage, this diagnosis carries a lot of fear and stigma. Doctors may use this diagnosis when someone has more long term difficulties with voices, visions, beliefs and muddled thinking - but it is rarely used for children and young people in the UK. When a child has severe problems it’s much more common for professionals to speak in terms of psychosis, anxiety, depression, PTSD or emotional problems.

Many young people who hear voices are not diagnosed with psychosis or another mental health problem. However, if your child is given a diagnosis - try to remember that these are merely labels and cannot predict the future. At Voice Collective, our manager was diagnosed with schizophrenia as a young adult. She now works full time, is no longer unwell and lives a life she loves. No matter what the problem is - recovery IS possible.",,,

The range of potential causes can feel quite confusing. Some parents find that they tie themselves in knots trying to understand why this is happening to their child. The problem is, no-one can give you a definitive answer to why your child is hearing voices (the root cause). Different people, different doctors and different researchers will have different ideas.

Given that many young people don’t have problems with hearing voices or visions, a more helpful question is: Why do some young people hear voices that they struggle to cope with?",,,
Parents-Voices-and-Visions-Booklet-2014_web.pdf,https://static1.squarespace.com/static/6308d9191f5d606799324692/t/639b1abcc9227b0d33facaf3/1671109309094/Parents-Voices-and-Visions-Booklet-2014_web.pdf,"Voices, visions and emotions

Whatever their root cause, difficult or distressing voices tend to be related to difficult or distressing feelings (including fear, guilt, anxiety, powerlessness, insecurity and anger). These feelings can stem from life experiences that the young person has not been able to deal with.

If your child is struggling with voices and visions it is helpful to think about what may have happened, in their past or present, that could be troubling them. Sometimes this is obvious, for example, you may know that your child has been bullied at school or has lost someone close to them. They may have experienced some form of abuse, or be struggling with their schoolwork. Other times, it is less clear and needs some investigation. In this case, it is worth seeing the voices as messengers. The things they say, and their underlying themes, often point to difficulty itself.

Escher describes hearing voices as ‘mostly a reaction to a situation or a problem the child or young person cannot cope with. It is a signal.’ So, if your child is struggling with voices it is important to help them to find someone to talk to about their feelings - so that they can deal with any underlying problems.",,,

Listen to your child and take them seriously but don’t forget to look after yourself too

Jo*, Parent of a child supported by Voice Collective

Once the problems underneath difficult voices are addressed, many young people find that the voices they hear either disappear completely or become more helpful. Others find that the voices stay the same, but they themselves have become more confident and feel able to cope with experiences that previously overwhelmed them.",,,

Don’t Panic: The most important thing you can do is to stay calm. Although this may seem difficult, it is vital you show your child that you are not afraid of the voices they hear and don’t see them as ‘mad’ or ‘crazy’.

Believe Them: Hearing voices and seeing visions is a really common experience in childhood - so, if your child says they’re hearing voices it’s likely that they are. Young people can be very sensitive to the reactions of the people closest to them, so show they as clearly as you can that you’re taking what they say seriously, even if it sounds unusual.

Space To Talk: It’s hard to make sense of experiences if you keep them inside. So, if your child would like to talk about their voices, visions or feelings - encourage them to do so. Ask them whether they would like to tell you more about what’s going on for them, and show that you’re interested. Really try to listen to what they are describing, asking them questions if they find it helpful.

If your child’s beliefs or experiences sound strange, try and listen without judgement. Remember that they’re trying to describe, and make sense 15

of, experiences that are quite extraordinary. Under the circumstances, unusual beliefs are quite understandable. Try not to get caught up in arguments about logic and reality - if you’re unsure how to respond just focus on how they are feeling.

If your child finds talking difficult, then explore other ways of helping them to open up. Some young people find it easier to talk whilst they’re walking or doing an activity. Others prefer to write or draw about how they are feeling, and then show it a parent afterwards. There is no right way to communicate - find a method that works for you and your child.

Avoid Assumptions: If your child is distressed and tells you they hear voices it’s easy to jump to the conclusion that the voices are causing the problem. This is understandable, but it can mean that the real problem your child is worrying about can go unaddressed (e.g. bullying or problems at school). Try and be open to whatever your child wants to say to you, and check things out if you’re unsure what they mean.

Hold The Hope: Struggling with voices can make your child feel isolated and different from the people around them. They may worry that they’re going ‘crazy’, so it can really help to know that these experiences are relatively common (1 in 12 young people hear voices) and that they do not always lead to mental health problems. Even those who are overwhelmed by voices and experience psychosis can, and do, recover and live the life they want to live.

Coping Strategies: If your child is struggling, there are lots of simple ways that they can begin to deal with difficult experiences. In general, strategies that promote feelings of safety and deal with the underlying difficult emotions are most helpful. As a parent you will already have ideas about how your child copes with stress; your child will have some good ideas too. These strategies can help with voices and visions.

When we speak about hearing voices, we’re talking about people seeing, hearing or sensing things that other people around them don’t. Some people have experiences which comfort, inspire or make them laugh. Others have ones that are more frightening and confusing. Many have a bit of both (3).

This experience is different for everyone who experiences it, and different people explain their experiences in different ways.

The medical model (which is the dominant narrative) often uses the term ‘psychosis’ to describe these experiences, however this approach doesn’t always fit or make sense with everyone's experience, so we encourage people to find a narrative that works for them.

Hearing voices can be understood in many different ways; spiritual/paranormal, a gift, ‘psychosis’ or ‘schizophrenia’, individual difference, a result of trauma, dissociation, or physical health problems and all of these have a place. (4)",,,

The area of cannabis and hearing voices or “psychosis” has long been dominated by the medical model, producing narratives that can and do make sense for some people.

However, there is a distinct lack of information and resources that have influence from young people themselves, from and for the people that have gone through this first hand.

Also, views in society towards cannabis can be polarized, with some people actively campaigning for its legalisation and others believing its bad for everyone, so we hope this represents a more neutral standpoint, providing information on a rarely discussed experience.

While this booklet will not and does not claim to represent all experiences, we hope it produces a source of information, and understanding of an issue that isn’t straightforward.

While we don’t encourage people to use cannabis we support a harm reduction approach, and encourage people to contact the organisations towards the end if you want support and further information about what we talk about in this leaflet.",,,

Research suggests that there is a link between smoking cannabis (especially cannabis with higher THC levels) and psychotic symptoms in young adults (5).

However, most people who use cannabis do not go onto develop ‘psychosis’ or ‘schizophrenia’, and for people who do identify with psychosis and schizophrenia diagnoses, they may have never used cannabis (6).

The conversation around ‘psychosis’ and cannabis often ignores the significance of social and systemic factors in terms of being barriers to wellbeing (7). These factors have been overlooked in the conversation around risk – things such as poverty, childhood trauma and oppression many of which also increase levels of stress, a known risk factor in ‘psychosis’ (8).

Some young people Voice Collective have talked to have said it can increase the frequency of the voices they hear or change the dialogue or sound. This can mean your experiences can become different in terms of intensity, how distressing it is, and what you're experiencing.

Its important to be aware that using cannabis can interact with some psychiatric medications (tricyclic antidepressants), so speak to your prescriber when using both (9).

I still smoke mainly because with lockdown I don’t have anything else to do. I don’t know if it was the skunk or the fact I'm dealing with childhood trauma, different people have different opinions, but all I do know is if you have trauma, distressing experiences, then skunk can make it come to the forefront, and it can completely overwhelm you. ”",,,

Research by the University of Oxford in 2014 found that using cannabis (with high levels of THC) can cause short-term paranoia . However the study also stressed that paranoia has multiple causes such as anxiety and low self esteem, and the paranoia declined as the THC left the system (10).

Some young people Voice Collective have talked to us say they sometimes can get thoughts that someone else wants to harm them, that other people are interfering with their thoughts and feelings. They may start to believe things that other people might call untrue. They can feel like they’re being followed. With this they sometimes get physical effects such as fast heart rate, sweaty palms, shaking etc.

If this becomes more intense after having cannabis, it could help to use grounding techniques in page X and it might be worth considering seeking more information or support.

“When I first smoked it, it was a laugh in the park with a few mates, not a big deal. And it wasn’t a big deal for a while. But when I started smoking it multiple times a day it was like everything got louder, a lot more intense, I didn’t feel in control anymore, I didn’t feel like me.

By this stage I was smoking up to 8 times a day. And I just lost it. I lost all connections with the world and became consumed by distressing feelings. I thought the world was ending and I couldn’t trust anyone because my voices became suspicious of everyone.",,,

Visions and cannabis…

Some people have found that cannabis can produce an experience of seeing something that others cant see, sometimes for the first time. For other people it can make their visions scarier, more frequent and more distressing.

Multiplicity and cannabis ….

Some young people have found that smoking cannabis can cause feelings of dissociation, where they feel disconnected from their feelings, thoughts, memories or sense of identity. For young people that experience multiplicity, using cannabis can cause other scarier identities or parts to come to the fore front and it can cause distress.

The other senses… (smells, taste, feeling) Sometimes using cannabis can cause people to feel hypersensitive in terms of their senses, more than usual. This means for people that can smell, taste or feel what others cant, their experiences may change, or become more distressing.

These experiences are not stand alone and many people experience more than one of these, and a lot of people find they can be connected.",,,

2 – Hydration (drink sips of water) 3 - Fresh air (open the window or sit outside) 4 - Sit in a comfortable position (loosen tight clothing) 5 – Breathing (take slow deep breaths, in through your nose and out through your mouth, try and be aware of the air going through your lungs, inflating and deflating)

Also, don’t use any more cannabis and don’t mix with other substances such as alcohol. Once you feel more relaxed, it may be good to get some sleep, listen to some soothing and relaxing music, or distract yourself. Grounding techniques/ toolbox

Name:

I’ve smoked probably thousands of times, but I remember one time I had a really bad experience, I totally freaked out. For a while it made my voices so loud, they weren’t talking anymore, they were screaming, I was so scared. However I was really lucky to have my friend with me, and she encouraged me to take deep breaths, to sit down, to drink water, and eventually it calmed down.

5 things you can see, 5 you can hear and 5 you can feel 4 things you can see, 4 you can hear and 4 you can feel 3 things you can see, 3 you can hear and 3 you can feel 2 things you can see, 2 you can hear and 2 you can feel 1 thing you can see, 1 you can hear and 1 you can feel (1)

When thinking about talking to someone you trust, consider;

- Who are you most comfortable with?

- Who has been supportive in the past?

- Who do you think will be able to help you most?

Money – Cannabis isn’t cheap, especially if you're smoking regularly and using a lot. Sometimes people spend more as time goes on, however this usually improves if you stop.

Relationships – Using cannabis can be a strain on your relationships, especially with different people having different views on it. Cannabis can also bring up anxiety for the people around you because of the potential effects.

Work/ School – Cannabis can significantly decrease your motivation and concentration, especially while intoxicated, which can mean that you struggle to stay focused at school or work.

Memory – A common experience while using cannabis with higher THC is disruption to short-term/working memory, however this isn’t permanent (12).

Physical Health – Often people smoke cannabis with tobacco, and this can cause damage to the lungs, teeth and overall health.

Mental Health – Cannabis (especially skunk) can make people feel activated and at times overwhelmed. As we mentioned, using cannabis with higher levels of THC, can heighten sensory perception which overlaps with ‘psychosis’.

Treatment by professionals – If you use cannabis, professionals can sometimes focus on that being the main issue, even if you don’t agree.",,,

Medical model – The medical model is the way lots of western society look at disability – within a biological context, looking at cause and effect, and often prescribing medications to fix ‘abnormalities’.

Psychosis – ‘Psychosis’ is defined by the NHS as when someone loses touch with reality (13) which might involve ‘hallucinations’ (when you hear or see something that others cant) or ‘delusions’ (when you believe something that other people would say is untrue).

Schizophrenia – ‘Schizophrenia’ is a severe long-term mental health condition (14). It causes a range of different psychological symptoms. Doctors often say schizophrenia is a type of ‘psychosis’.

Skunk - The generic name given to potent strains of the cannabis plant containing the highest levels of the psychoactive ingredient tetrahydrocannabinol (THC).

THC – Tetrahydrocannabinol is a compound in cannabis which largely produces hallucinogenic effects

CBD – Cannabidiol is another compound found in cannabis. Its thought that CBD can balance out the effects of THC.",,,

So, it is not unusual that we may have experienced changes in the things we are hearing, seeing or sensing. At Voice Collective we know how challenging it can be trying to navigate these changes and want to highlight that you are not alone in how you may be feeling.

For some of us the voices may have acted as an ally during lockdown, providing companionship and acting as a welcome distraction. For others they may have made the entire lockdown experience that much more difficult. Voices and visions may have been more active than usual, they might have reflected current themes surrounding the pandemic such as fear, isolation and illness, or they may not have been affected at all. Everyone’s experiences will be different.

I know that there are various times during lockdown where I felt very overwhelmed. How will I cope with not being able to exercise at the gym or have my usual routine? Will I be able to hide my mental health state from my family or flat mates? How am I going to stay connected to my friends and family if I can’t see them?I’ve now learned that many other people had similar worries. For that reason, I thought it would be helpful to compile a short list of five coping mechanisms to managing voices and visions at this time.

While reading these coping strategies remember that not everything will work for everyone. Trial and error may help find what works best for you. It is also okay not to be “coping” 100% of the time, we are only human, and we are allowed to have bad days.",,,

As well as the physical isolation that lockdown enforced, it is not uncommon to feel mentally and emotionally isolated. This can be made even more difficult when you are struggling to cope with your voices and visions. It may be helpful to have various contacts who you are able to speak to regularly, people who make you feel comfortable and safe.

These people can be a listening ear when you feel overwhelmed, a sounding board when you’re feeling confused, or just a good conversation on a quiet afternoon. They could be a friend, a stranger on a helpline or a fellow member of a peer support group. Either way connecting with others on a social level may help you feel less isolated.",,,

Grounding strategies are techniques and objects used to help you feel ‘grounded’ in the present moment. They can be useful when you feel lost in your thoughts. This may be particularly useful during this time due to the large amount of information and misinformation constantly circulating around Covid-19.

These techniques focus on the senses. For example, you may feel grounded by smelling an essential oil or sucking on a strong flavoured mint. Another technique some people find helpful is writing down grounding statements, e.g., write down 5 things you can hear, 5 things you can see, and 5 you can feel. It is important to really focus on what you’re seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting or touching when practicing grounding.",,,

Due to Covid-19, many of us have been spending more time in the same environment and around the same people than we would usually. As well as this lack of physical space, we may feel like the voices are taking up a lot of our mental space. This can leave us feeling confined and anxious. Decorating and making changes to your living space can make it feel new and different, and also give you a creative project to work on.

Establishing a routine can help with disorientation. It’s easy to become disoriented when you have been thrown out of your regular routine or are living a completely different lifestyle to one you had envisioned or lived previously. Trying to schedule in regular activities everyday (such as going for a walk, meditating or reading a book) can feel very stabilizing and help get you out of your head.",,,

Empowerment is all about changing the power dynamic between you and your voices. Translating the voices is one form of empowerment. Sometimes voices say things that may need some interpretation. For example, a voice saying, ‘you’re going to infect everyone’ might be interpreted as saying ‘you’re worried about other people’, or ‘be careful to stay 2m away from others’.

Similarly, you may find it useful to question what the voices are saying. This can be difficult when the voices sound powerful but being sceptical and talking through what the voice said with someone else can help clarify and ease anxiety.",,,
VC+COVID+PIECE.pdf,http://www.voicecollective.co.uk/coping/,"5. Self-care

Be kind to yourself. This is a tough time, and it is important to be patient with yourself. Making sure you do something for yourself every day is a good way to put yourself first. This may be painting, doing some exercise, watching a movie, or anything else that makes you feel good about yourself. If you find it difficult to do these things on your own enlisting a friend or joining an online group/class might help.

“When I hear voices and see things I feel very scared. They threaten me every day, ask me to do

things I do not want to do … something I know is wrong and unsafe. They also tell me people are

spying on me or people are not who they are not who they say they are. They can also shout at me

or talk about what I am doing to each other. At times I feel as if they are in control of me or of those

around me. When it is at its worst I feel as if I am trapped in another world, I cannot escape.

I used to have 12 voices (they are the voices of children), but now there are more. I see a man in

black, who follows me around and threatens me, the spirits of 3 children he murdered and a person,

who sometimes appears as a woman and sometimes as a child, who has a badly scarred face. I aslo

see aliens, spiders, scorpians, spirits, things changing colour or . At times I struggle to cope and have

felt suicidal because I have to cope with this every day.

No one else hears MY voices – only me (they told me I was the chosen one), but through the project

I have met other people who hear voice too, so I know I am not alone.

I cannot remember a day when I did not hear the voice, because they began when I was so young.

It is hard for people to understand how it feels to hear voices and see things. When I was in hosptial

someone told me I was imagining the voices. This really upset me, because it was not true. I began

to feel as if people thought I was lying and I did not want to talk about it to anyone. When I do, I

feel embarrassed and worried about how they wil react. I do not feel doctors always understand.

My mum has always been there for me since the beginning. She helps me to feel safe and uses

excercises and games to help distract me. If I want to talk about the voi ces I can, but she never

forces me, it is my choice. Sometimes I just need a hug. I also have a supportive sister.

The Voice Collective Project has been amazing. They really understand me and how I feel, because

they have heard voices too. I know they believe me too, which is important. They help me to

challenge the voices and and feel safer by giving me coping strategies. I go to a weekly group where

I have met other young people who are experiencing similar, which has helped me to realise I am not

alone. I also meet with the project individually or communicate with them by telephone or email.

They are always there for me. They focus on the postive aspects of what I achieve, not on what I do

not acheive and are always there to listen. I have also particpated in art and drama workshops with

the project, which were brilliant. I trust everyone at the project and they know and understand me

too. They have really helped me and I will always be thankfull to them.”",,,

“I’ve heard voices for over ten years now, and in the beginning was utterly tormented by them. What

made the difference for me was getting away from psychiatry’s conventional ‘cure’ response – which

is ignoring the voices, dismissing them as meaningless or trying to medicate them away.

Instead I began to explore, understand, accept and integrate the emotional meaning of the voices in

terms of my life history – the recovery response. I’m no longer frightened by my experiences, and

would even miss the voices if they went! And because I’ve been able to change the relationship with my voices I can give them a personal and positive meaning, take pride in my experience, reclaim it,

take control of it – and just get on with it!

The way I see it is that when my mum’s really stressed she gets bad migraines, and when I’m really

stressed I get bad voices – it’s as simple, and no more scary, than that”.",,,

“I first heard voices and saw things when I was 14. Because of abuse, I wasn’t happy child, but after

the voices came, I knew there were children in hell, because that’s where I was. Because of the fear I

stopped going to school. I reached out for people to help me but got disapproval, threats, violence

and coldness instead.

People kept telling me to pull my socks up. It is hard to do that if you think demons are eating your

soul. I was in hell and professionals were adding petrol to keep it going. It was only when one person

said to me in my early 30s, I believe in you and you have the power to change that the hell quelled

and the fire began to turn into light.

I felt as a teenager with these experiences that I shouldn’t dream. Basically I was told I wasn’t

allowed to. But dreams can come true. Mine have. What I want to say to young people with these

experiences not to stop dreaming because with some support and a little self-belief, you can make

your dreams come true”.",,,

“I have co-existed with my voices for as many years as my memory can recall. It started off mainly as

a mixture of a positive, but occasionally bothersome, experience. I was comfortable with our

coexistence for many years, until when I was 14, when the voices really turned up the heat and the

volume. I gradually descended into a set of beliefs surrounding myself, as my voices became

increasingly angry and violent. One of them vanished, and in the vacuum the other began speaking

twice as much.

Luckily I was able to contact Voice Collective relatively early into my distressing experiences, and they

really helped. I hopped in and out of hospital like it was going out of fashion, and received a

diagnosis which I didn’t really agree with. I’ve began to develop a working relationship with my voice,

and tried to understand her and what drives her.

I don’t think ‘recovery’ and ‘not hearing voices’ are the same thing- if anything, I get more upset

when I have a period of ‘silence’! My voices have been a very formative experience in my life, and

with Voice Collective’s help, I’m discovering more about my self and my experiences than being

labeled or medicating ever could”.",,,
