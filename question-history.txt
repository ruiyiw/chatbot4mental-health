I constantly hear my deceased granny's voice at night. Am I sick?
Does cannabis cause my hallucinations?
My kid said he heard someone talking to him last night but no one was present. What's wrong with him?
I feel lonely in my new school. Can you help me?
I broke up with my best friend yesterday. I felt so sad and cried all day. Will I ever get better?
I cannot help but think about self-suicide for weeks. What should I do?
